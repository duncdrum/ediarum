ediarum
=======

ediarum is a package of three different combinable software solutions and technologies: eXistdb, Oxygen XML Author and ConTeXt. The package and multiple extensions - not the software himself - are developed by TELOTA - an iniatitve for the "Digital Humanities" at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Together these options create a digital work environment in which manuscripts and other TEI-XML documents can easily be transcribed and edited. Note that ediarum must always be customized for the individual project.
